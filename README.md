# a-small-bank-sytem-made-in-qt
A small bank system made in Qt. 

This program has a login screen and a sign up screen where the users can access their account by inserting the informations.
The system also has a small database that is rebuilt every time the aplication in opened.

I tried to follow a basic design pattern to keep the code organized, i hope you like it!

The aplication is built with QMake and Qt -v 6.2.4
